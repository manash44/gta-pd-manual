                            they would have a reasonable expectation of privacy unless they have probable cause or a
                            search warrant. This includes garages, houses and vehicles. Probable cause to search exists

                            reasonable person to believe that a crime was commited at the place to be searched, or that
                            evidence of a crime exists at that location. However, law enforcement officers do not need
                            probable cause to search when they have received consent from the person; when they conduct
                            certain searches connected to a lawful arrest; or in emergency sitautions which threaten
                            public safety or the loss of evidence. police also do not need probable cause to search and
                            seize contraband which is in plain sight. Without probable cause, an officer may still

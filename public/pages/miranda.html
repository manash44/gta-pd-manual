        <p>
            <strong>Miranda rights</strong> are a set of rights that law enforcement must inform individuals of
            before conducting a custodial interrogation. These rights are derived from the <strong>Fifth
                Amendment's</strong> protection against self-incrimination and the <strong>Sixth
                Amendment's</strong> right to counsel.
